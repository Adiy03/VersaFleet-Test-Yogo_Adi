# VersaFleetTest - Yogo Adi

This is a project that I created to complete the test from VersaFleet

I named this project Friend App, created using the node.Js programming language

To run this application, you need to clone or download the zip file then enter the terminal directory 
then start by running the program "node app.js" in this file directory

Previously you need to have or have installed the node and express applications on your device to run this Friend App program
